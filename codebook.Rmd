Here, we're just setting a few options.

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  warning = TRUE, # show warnings during codebook generation
  message = TRUE, # show messages during codebook generation
  error = TRUE, # do not interrupt codebook generation in case of errors,
                # usually better for debugging
  echo = TRUE  # show R code
)
ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_bw())
pander::panderOptions("table.split.table", Inf)
```

Now, we're preparing our data for the codebook.

```{r prepare_codebook}
library(codebook)
library(here)
library(readr)
codebook_data <- read_csv(here("raw-data",  "2019.csv"))

### I have added a name to this dataset as metadata
metadata(codebook_data)$name <- "World Happiness reports data for 2019"

### practice!
### add temporal coverage metadata to this codebook
### take a look at the vignette if you're not sure how


# omit the following lines, if your missing values are already properly labelled
codebook_data <- detect_missing(codebook_data,
    only_labelled = TRUE, # only labelled values are autodetected as missing
    negative_values_are_missing = FALSE, # negative values are missing values
    ninety_nine_problems = TRUE,   # 99/999 are missing values, if they are more than 5 MAD from the median
    )

# The following line finds item aggregates with names like this:
# scale = scale_1 + scale_2R + scale_3R
# identifying these aggregates allows the codebook function to
# automatically compute reliabilities.
# However, it will not reverse items automatically.
codebook_data <- detect_scales(codebook_data)
```


Create codebook

```{r codebook}
codebook(codebook_data)
```
